<div id="search-component">
  <h4>Hero Search</h4>
 
  <!-- The search() method is called via an event binding 
    to the textbox's input event. 

    Every time the user types in the textbox, the binding calls 
    search() with the textbox value, a "search term". The searchTerms 
    becomes an Observable emitting a steady stream of search terms.
  -->
  <input #searchBox id="search-box" (input)="search(searchBox.value)" />
 
  <ul class="search-result">
    <!-- As the user types in the search 
      box, an input event binding calls the component's search() 
      method with the new search box value. 

      Look closely and you'll see that the *ngFor 
      iterates over a list called heroes$, not heroes.

      The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an 
      Observable, not an array.
      The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable. But there's 
      also a pipe character (|) followed by async, which identifies 
      Angular's AsyncPipe.
      The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so you 
      won't have to do so in the component class.
